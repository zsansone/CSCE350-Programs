To use the QuickSort analysis just run the code and the required input files will be generated. 

In my test, the values I got were
Size  AverageTimeSeconds
10    3.4997e-07
100    6.73676e-06
1000    8.14859e-05
10000    0.00109585
100000    0.0130906

the graphical version of this is included as "graph.png"

Run the program with ./run.sh which will automatically display the output text in the terminal. You can also open the output.txt file to read the output.

If there are permission erros, run chmod +x run.sh and then rerun the bash script.
