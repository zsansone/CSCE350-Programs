To use the quicksort and mergesort algorithms, ensure that there is an input.txt file with a set of floats seperated by white space. Output.txt will be overidden with a new output if a new input is provided or created if there is none in the directory.

Run the program with ./run.sh which will automatically display the output text in the terminal. You can also open the output.txt file to read the output.

If there are permission erros, run chmod +x run.sh and then rerun the bash script.
