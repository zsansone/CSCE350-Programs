To use the MaxHeap and MinHeap algorithms, ensure that there is an input.txt file with a the number of keys on the first line and the next line contains unsorted keys seperated by blank space

Run the program with ./runMax.sh and runMin.sh respectively which will automatically display the output text in the terminal. You can also open the minOutput.txt and maxOutput.txt file to read the output.

If there are permission erros, do chmod +x runMax.sh and chmod +x runMin.sh and then rerun the bash script.
